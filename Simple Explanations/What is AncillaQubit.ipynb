    "The term **\"Ancilla\"** is used to describe additional qubits used in quantum computation for auxiliary or temporary operations. Within a quantum circuit, primary qubits (data qubits) are employed to perform specific calculations, while **ancilla qubits** are used for additional auxiliary information or temporary computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ancilla qubits are utilized to make computations more efficient and to execute specific quantum algorithms. For example, certain quantum algorithms like Shor's factorization algorithm or Grover's search algorithm can operate more quickly by using ancilla qubits. Ancilla qubits can contribute to computations by taking advantage of quantum mechanical properties such as superposition and quantum entanglement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proper design and utilization of ancilla qubits are essential for solving quantum computation problems more efficiently. Depending on the design and operation of specific quantum circuits, ancilla qubits can be employed in varying numbers and positions."
