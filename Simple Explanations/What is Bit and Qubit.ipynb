    "The \"bit,\" the basic data processing unit of computers, can represent only two values: 0 and 1. Classical computers process and store information using this simple unit of data millions or billions of times. Each \"bit\" is represented by a physical component, such as a transistor in an electrical circuit, and this transistor can be in either an on (1) or off (0) state. Bits allow computers to perform logical operations and manage complex calculations. Therefore, computers mainly use bits to process and store data in technological devices in our daily lives.*"

    "\n",
    "Quantum computers use units we call Qubits instead of classical bits. A qubit can be both 0 and 1 at the same time, not just 0 or 1 like a classical bit. This situation is called **superposition**. Additionally, qubits, unlike classical bits, can be connected to each other thanks to quantum properties such as quantum entanglement. This can affect the state of one qubit on another qubit. Qubits can perform complex calculations simultaneously using quantum gates. This has the potential to solve some computational problems much faster than classical computers. However, qubits are highly sensitive to environmental noise and quantum effects, so they require protection and correction methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while bits represent only two states (0 and 1), qubits are capable of representing more complex information with both superposition and quantum entanglement properties. This makes quantum computers have the potential to solve some specific computational problems faster, but also requires more complex technology and infrastructure."
