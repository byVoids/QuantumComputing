    "Qubit state refers to the state in quantum mechanics of the qubit, the fundamental unit of information in quantum computing.Qubits can take values 0 and 1 like bits in classical computers, but they are also in a state called quantum superposition. This means that a qubit can be both 0 and 1 at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The qubit state is usually represented by a two-dimensional sphere called a Bloch sphere. Any point on the Bloch sphere represents a possible state of the qubit. The north pole of the Bloch sphere represents the ∣0⟩ state, the south pole represents the ∣1⟩ state, and the other points of the sphere represent the superpositions of the ∣0⟩ and ∣1⟩ states.\n",

    "The state of the qubit collapses into one of the ∣0⟩ or ∣1⟩ states when measured. The probability of measurement results depends on the state of the qubit before the measurement. For example, if the qubit is in the ∣0⟩ state, the probability of the measurement result being ∣0⟩ is 1.\n",
