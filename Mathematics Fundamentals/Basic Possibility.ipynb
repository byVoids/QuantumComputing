    "* Probability is the mathematical value or probability percentage of something happening or not happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The concept of probability is expressed in the following terms;**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **P(X) (Probability of X):** P(X) expresses the probability of an event (X) occurring. It is a number used to determine how many times this event occurs or occurs in an experiment. It usually takes a value between 0 and 1. **0** means that **X** event will never happen, **1** means that the event will definitely happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **P(X and Y) (Probability of X and Y Occurring Together):** P(X and Y) refers to the probability of two different events (X and Y) occurring at the same time. For example, let's consider the probability of getting a 4 on one roll of the dice (P(X)) and the probability of getting a 6 on another roll of the dice at the same time (P(Y)). P(X and Y) calculates the probability of both events occurring at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **P(X or Y) (Probability of X or Y occurring):** P(X or Y) expresses the probability of at least one of two different events occurring. For example, let's consider the probability of drawing a red card (X) or a heart card (Y) from a deck of cards. P(X or Y) calculates the probability of either X or Y occurring."

    "\n",
    "It refers to a situation where two or more events or situations cannot occur at the same time or are mutually exclusive. If two events or situations are \"mutually exclusive\", if one occurs, the other cannot occur. To give an example, this situation: The status of a student passing and failing an exam. The student either passes or fails the exam, not both at the same time. Both of these situations are mutually exclusive."

The results of both dice rolls are independent of each other. The result of one dice does not affect the result of the other dice. Therefore, the results of the two dice are independent.\n",

This does not include the situation where both events occur at the same time because they are already dependent.\n",
